        I am Yeonjae Choi, a 23-year-old third-year student majoring in IT Intelligence Information Engineering at Jeonbuk National University. 
        Last year, after taking a course on networking, I became interested in the field and joined the 'Distributed Network Lab.' There, I studied communication and network technologies and gained valuable research experience related to various networking technologies. I also worked with peers who shared similar goals to prepare for the CCNA certification.
        Currently, I am expanding my interest to include cloud computing. I plan to work on a project where I build and manage infrastructure using AWS. Through this experience, I aim to develop the skills to build and maintain stable and efficient systems in both network and cloud environments in the professional field.
